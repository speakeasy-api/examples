    "answer": "Based on the Django 5.2 documentation provided, I cannot identify specific new features for Django 5.2. The documentation shows this is a development version (Release 5.2.8.dev20251017180519) dated October 17, 2025, but the content provided consists mainly of the table of contents and tutorial sections that don't highlight version-specific features.\n\nThe documentation does mention one new feature that appears to be introduced in this version:\n\n**Composite Primary Keys** - Listed as section 3.13 \"Composite primary keys\" in the \"Using Django\" section, which suggests this is a newly added feature allowing models to use multiple fields as a primary key.\n\nTo get a complete list of Django 5.2's new features, you would need to check the release notes section (Chapter 9) or the \"What's new\" documentation that typically accompanies new Django releases."
